### Cache Replacement Policies Overview FIFO

Cache replacement policies, also known as cache algorithms, are strategies used by computer systems to manage the content of caches. Caches improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in faster memory locations. When the cache is full, the replacement policy determines which items to discard to make space for new data. The two main metrics used to evaluate cache performance are latency (how quickly data can be retrieved from the cache) and hit ratio (how often requested data is found in the cache).

### Key Concepts and Formulas

**Average Memory Reference Time (T):**
\[ T = m \times T_m + T_h + E \]

- **m:** Miss ratio (1 - hit ratio)
- **T_m:** Time to access main memory on a cache miss
- **T_h:** Latency to reference the cache
- **E:** Secondary effects, such as queuing in multiprocessor systems

### Types of Cache Replacement Policies

1. **Optimal Replacement (Bélády's Algorithm):**
   - Discards the data that will not be needed for the longest time.
   - Example: Predicting that data item '5' won't be needed soon, so it gets replaced first.
   - Not practical since future access patterns are usually unknown.

2. **Random Replacement (RR):**
   - Selects a random item to discard when the cache is full.
   - Example: ARM processors use this due to its simplicity.

3. **First In First Out (FIFO):**
   - Discards the oldest item in the cache.
   - Example: A cache containing pages 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' will discard 'A' when a new page 'E' is added.

4. **Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FILO):**
   - Discards the most recently added item.
   - Example: A cache containing pages 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' will discard 'D' when a new page 'E' is added.

5. **SIEVE:**
   - Designed for web caches, quickly evicts newly inserted objects while retaining useful ones.
   - Example: A FIFO queue where new objects are at the head and old objects at the tail, with quick demotion of new objects.

6. **Least Recently Used (LRU):**
   - Discards the least recently used item.
   - Example: A cache containing pages 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'. When 'E' is accessed, 'A' (the least recently used) is replaced.

7. **Time-Aware Least Recently Used (TLRU):**
   - Adds a validity lifetime to cache items, discarding them based on their time-to-use (TTU).
   - Example: Content with a short TTU is replaced faster than content with a long TTU.

8. **Most Recently Used (MRU):**
   - Discards the most recently used item.
   - Example: A cache containing pages 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'. When 'E' is accessed, 'D' (the most recently used) is replaced.

### Examples and Practical Use Cases

- **Video and Audio Streaming:** Typically have low hit ratios as data is accessed sequentially and only once.
- **Database Servers:** Require maintaining cache coherence when multiple servers update a shared data file.

### Practical Considerations

- **Hit Ratio:** Higher hit ratios can be achieved by tracking more usage information, but this can increase latency.
- **Latency:** Faster strategies track less information to reduce update time.
- **Application Specific:** Hit ratios and the effectiveness of algorithms can vary significantly between different applications and workloads.

In conclusion, choosing an appropriate cache replacement policy involves balancing the trade-offs between hit ratio, latency, and the specific needs of the application. Each algorithm offers different benefits and is suited to different types of workloads.



### Segmented LRU (SLRU)

An SLRU cache is divided into two segments: probationary and protected. The probationary segment holds newly added data, while the protected segment contains data that has been accessed at least twice. Data from a miss is added to the probationary segment, and if accessed again, it moves to the protected segment. If the protected segment is full, the least recently used item moves back to the probationary segment. When data must be discarded, it is removed from the least recently used end of the probationary segment.

### LRU Approximations

**Pseudo-LRU (PLRU):**
- Suitable for CPU caches with high associativity.
- Uses a binary tree of one-bit pointers to approximate LRU.
- Example: In a 4-way associative cache, accessing a new value replaces the value indicated by the pointers.

**Clock-Pro:**
- An approximation of LIRS, designed for low-cost implementation.
- Uses three "clock hands" to measure data reuse and evict one-time-access or low-locality items.
- Combines benefits of LRU and Clock algorithms.

### Simple Frequency-Based Policies

**Least Frequently Used (LFU):**
- Discards items that are used the least frequently.
- Example: If data A is accessed 5 times and data B is accessed 2 times, B is discarded first.

**Least Frequent Recently Used (LFRU):**
- Combines LFU and LRU.
- Cache is divided into privileged and unprivileged partitions.
- Example: Frequently accessed content is moved to the privileged partition.

**LFU with Dynamic Aging (LFUDA):**
- Adds a cache-age factor to reference counts.
- Example: If data A is frequently accessed but becomes unpopular, it will eventually be replaced due to dynamic aging.

**S3-FIFO:**
- Uses three FIFO queues: small (10%), main (90%), and ghost (metadata).
- Example: New objects enter the small queue; if reaccessed, they move to the main queue. Evicted objects' metadata is tracked in the ghost queue.

### RRIP-Style Policies

**Re-Reference Interval Prediction (RRIP):**
- Predicts when cache lines will be reused based on re-reference prediction value (RRPV).
- Example: On a miss, evict the line with the highest RRPV. If none have the maximum RRPV, increment all RRPVs and repeat.

### Examples and Practical Use Cases

**SLRU:**
- Useful in scenarios where certain data needs a "second chance" before being discarded.

**PLRU:**
- Common in CPU caches where associativity is high, reducing overhead compared to true LRU.

**Clock-Pro:**
- Used in systems where cost and complexity need to be minimized, such as in operating systems.

**LFU and Variants:**
- Ideal for applications with stable access patterns, where frequently accessed items remain useful over time.

**S3-FIFO:**
- Demonstrates high efficiency and scalability, suitable for web cache workloads with high throughput requirements.

**RRIP:**
- Effective in scenarios where data reuse patterns are predictable, balancing between scan resistance and aging out old data.


### Static RRIP (SRRIP)
SRRIP inserts cache lines with the highest re-reference prediction value (RRPV), making newly inserted lines most likely to be evicted on a cache miss.

### Bimodal RRIP (BRRIP)
BRRIP aims to prevent cache thrashing, which occurs when the working set is much larger than the cache size. It usually inserts lines with the highest RRPV, but occasionally inserts lines with a slightly lower RRPV (randomly with a low probability). This randomness helps some lines "stick" in the cache, reducing thrashing. SRRIP is better when the working set is smaller than the cache, while BRRIP is better for larger working sets.

### Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP)
DRRIP dynamically chooses between SRRIP and BRRIP using set dueling. It allocates a few cache sets to use SRRIP and another few to use BRRIP, monitoring their performance to decide which policy to use for the rest of the cache.

### Policies Approximating Bélády's Algorithm

**Hawkeye:**
- Uses past accesses to predict future cache behavior.
- Samples non-aligned cache sets and emulates Bélády's algorithm on these accesses.
- Determines whether instructions are cache-friendly or cache-averse.
- Hawkeye's predictions are fed into an RRIP to manage eviction decisions.
- Won the CRC2 cache championship in 2017.

**Mockingjay:**
- Builds on Hawkeye by making more granular decisions.
- Keeps a sampled cache of unique accesses, PCs, and timestamps.
- Uses a reuse distance predictor (RDP) to adjust predictions.
- On cache misses, evicts the line with the highest estimated time of reuse (ETR).

### Machine-Learning Policies
- Various policies use perceptrons, Markov chains, or other machine learning techniques to predict cache evictions.

### Other Policies

**Low Inter-reference Recency Set (LIRS):**
- Uses recency and inter-reference recency (IRR) to make replacement decisions.
- Divides pages into LIR (low IRR) and HIR (high IRR) sets.

**Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC):**
- Balances between LRU and LFU.
- Adjusts the size of protected and probationary segments based on evicted item information.

**Clock with Adaptive Replacement (CAR):**
- Combines ARC and Clock benefits.
- Self-tuning with no user-specified parameters.

**Multi-Queue (MQ):**
- Designed for second-level buffer caches.
- Contains multiple LRU queues representing a hierarchy based on block lifetimes.

**Pannier:**
- A flash caching mechanism using a survival-queue structure.
- Ranks containers based on survival time, proportional to live data.

### Static Analysis
- Determines cache hits or misses to indicate worst-case execution times.
- Uses "age" metrics to compute intervals for possible cache states.
- Efficiently analyzed using compact binary decision diagrams.
- Pseudo-LRU and FIFO policies pose higher complexity analysis problems than LRU.

These policies highlight the range of approaches available for cache replacement, each with unique benefits and use cases depending on system requirements and workload patterns.

By understanding these different cache replacement policies and their use cases, systems can be optimized for better performance and efficiency depending on the specific workload and access patterns.

## Cache-Oblivious Algorithm

A cache-oblivious algorithm is designed to utilize the processor cache efficiently without explicit knowledge of cache size or cache line length. These algorithms adapt to different machines and memory hierarchies without modification, contrasting with loop tiling, which optimizes for specific cache sizes.

### Optimal Cache-Oblivious Algorithms
Optimal cache-oblivious algorithms use the cache in an asymptotically optimal way, ignoring constant factors. Examples include algorithms for matrix multiplication, matrix transposition, sorting, and specific cases of the Cooley–Tukey FFT.

### Recursive Divide-and-Conquer
Cache-oblivious algorithms often employ a recursive divide-and-conquer approach, breaking problems into smaller subproblems until they fit into the cache. For instance, optimal cache-oblivious matrix multiplication divides matrices into smaller submatrices, multiplying them in a depth-first manner.

### History
The concept was proposed by Charles E. Leiserson in 1996 and published by Harald Prokop in his 1999 master's thesis at MIT. Predecessors include works on recursive FFTs and matrix algorithms in the 1990s.

### Idealized Cache Model
Cache-oblivious algorithms are analyzed using an idealized cache model, which simplifies cache characteristics. The model assumes:
- Memory divided into blocks of size \( B \).
- Cache holds \( M \) objects (\( M = \Omega(B^2) \)), fully associative.
- Optimal replacement policy (e.g., Least Recently Used, LRU).
- Complexity measured by the number of cache misses, similar to the external memory model but independent of cache parameters \( B \) and \( M \).

### Example: Matrix Transposition
A cache-oblivious matrix transposition algorithm divides matrices recursively until they fit into the cache, achieving optimal work complexity \( O(mn) \) and cache complexity \( O(1 + \frac{mn}{B}) \). This method reduces cache misses by ensuring submatrices fit into the cache during transposition.

### Practicality
- **Performance**: Cache-oblivious algorithms perform well when data exceeds main memory size. However, they may be outperformed by cache-aware algorithms and RAM-based algorithms for data fitting into main memory.
- **Implementation**: Cache-aware algorithms offer better performance and are not significantly harder to implement than cache-oblivious ones.
- **Comparison Studies**: Empirical studies have shown that cache-oblivious algorithms can lag behind cache-aware and RAM-based algorithms in execution time and memory usage, especially when data fits into main memory.

### Summary
Cache-oblivious algorithms provide a general approach to optimize cache usage across different systems without requiring detailed cache parameters. They are especially beneficial for large datasets exceeding main memory capacity, but may require machine-specific tuning to achieve near-optimal performance in practice.

## Distributed Cache

### Overview
A distributed cache extends the traditional cache concept to multiple servers, increasing size and transactional capacity. It's primarily used for storing application data, database content, and web session data. This has become feasible due to the decreasing cost of main memory and the increasing speed of network cards.

### Characteristics
- **Scalability**: Distributed caches can scale horizontally by adding more servers.
- **Performance**: They improve application performance by reducing the load on the database and providing faster access to frequently accessed data.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: They typically use lower-cost machines, unlike the more expensive hardware required for database servers.

### Sharding Strategies
To manage data across multiple servers, distributed caches use sharding, which assigns each cache key to a specific shard (partition):
- **Modulus Sharding**: Uses the modulus operation to assign keys.
- **Range-Based Sharding**: Assigns keys based on a range of values.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Distributes keys evenly across shards and maintains balance even if some shards fail or become unavailable.

### Applications
Distributed caches are crucial in environments where fast data retrieval and scalability are essential, such as:
- **Web Applications**: Storing session data and frequently accessed information.
- **Supercomputing**: Implemented as burst buffers to handle high-speed data operations.
- **Information-Centric Networking (ICN)**: Emerging internet architecture utilizing distributed cache networks.

### Examples of Distributed Cache Systems
- **Aerospike**
- **Apache Ignite**
- **Couchbase**
- **Ehcache**
- **GigaSpaces**
- **Hazelcast**
- **Infinispan**
- **Memcached**
- **Oracle Coherence**
- **Riak**
- **Redis**
- **SafePeak**
- **Tarantool**
- **Velocity/AppFabric**

### Conclusion
Distributed caching is a powerful approach for improving application performance and scalability by leveraging inexpensive, high-speed memory and network technologies. Various sharding strategies ensure efficient data distribution and resilience against server failures, making distributed caches essential for modern high-performance applications.

## We'll cover FIFO (First In, First Out), LIFO (Last In, First Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), MRU (Most Recently Used), and LFU (Least Frequently Used).

### 1. FIFO (First In, First Out)

In the FIFO cache replacement policy, the oldest entry (the first one that was added) is removed when the cache is full.

```python
class FIFOCache:

        self.capacity = capacity
        self.queue = []

    def get(self, key):

    def put(self, key, value):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache[key] = value
        else:
            if len(self.cache) >= self.capacity:
                oldest_key = self.queue.pop(0)
                del self.cache[oldest_key]
            self.cache[key] = value
            self.queue.append(key)

                del self.cache[last_key]
            self.cache[key] = value
            self.stack.append(key)

# Example Usage

```

### 3. LRU (Least Recently Used)

In the LRU cache replacement policy, the least recently accessed entry is removed when the cache is full.

        self.cache = OrderedDict()
        self.capacity = capacity

    def get(self, key):

            self.stack.append(key)
            return self.cache[key]
        return -1

    def put(self, key, value):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.stack.remove(key)
        elif len(self.cache) >= self.capacity:
            mru_key = self.stack.pop()
            del self.cache[mru_key]
        self.cache[key] = value
        self.stack.append(key)

# Example Usage
mru_cache = MRUCache(2)
mru_cache.put(1, 'A')
mru_cache.put(2, 'B')
print(mru_cache.get(1))  # Output: 'A'
mru_cache.put(3, 'C')
print(mru_cache.get(1))  # Output: 'A', as key 1 is accessed
print(mru_cache.get(2))  # Output: -1, as key 2 is the most recently used and removed
```

### 5. LFU (Least Frequently Used)

In the LFU cache replacement policy, the least frequently accessed entry is removed when the cache is full.

```python
import heapq

class LFUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.cache = {}
        self.freq = {}
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.min_heap = []

    def get(self, key):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.freq[key] += 1
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, (self.freq[key], key))
            return self.cache[key]
        return -1

    def put(self, key, value):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache[key] = value
            self.freq[key] += 1
        else:
            if len(self.cache) >= self.capacity:
                while self.min_heap:
                    freq, least_key = heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)
                    if self.freq[least_key] == freq:
                        del self.cache[least_key]
                        del self.freq[least_key]
                        break
            self.cache[key] = value
            self.freq[key] = 1
        heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, (self.freq[key], key))

# Example Usage
lfu_cache = LFUCache(2)
lfu_cache.put(1, 'A')
lfu_cache.put(2, 'B')
print(lfu_cache.get(1))  # Output: 'A'
lfu_cache.put(3, 'C')
print(lfu_cache.get(2))  # Output: -1, as key 2 is the least frequently used and removed
```
